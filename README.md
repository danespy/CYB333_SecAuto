# Password Strength Analyzer üîê

## Project Objectives
This tool helps users understand how strong their passwords are. It checks things like password length, character variety, and whether the password is easy to guess or very common. This project is part of the CYB333 security automation course.

## Features (Planned)
- Checks if the password is long enough
- Checks if it uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Warns if it's a very common or weak password
- Gives a score like "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong"
- (Optional) Can check if the password has appeared in a real data breach
